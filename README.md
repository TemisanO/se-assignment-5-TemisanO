4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

The Command Palette in VS Code:
The Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful feature that allows users to access and execute various commands quickly without needing to navigate through menus or remember keyboard shortcuts. It provides a quick way to perform tasks, such as opening files, changing settings and much more.

How to access the Command Palette:
The Command Palette is accessed using the following key combination: `Ctrl+Shift+P` for Windows.
Examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette are:
-	Open File
-  Toggle Terminal
-  GIT: Clone
-  GIT: Close Repository
-  Extensions: Install Extensions

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

      Integrated Terminal:
   To Open the Integrated Terminal:
   1.	Using Keyboard Shortcut:
   On Windows: Press Ctrl+ ` (backtick key).
   2.	Using the Menu:
   Click on the ‘View’ menu at the top of the window and select ‘Terminal’ from the dropdown menu.
   3.	Using the Command Palette:
   Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) to open the Command Palette. Type Create New Terminal and click on ‘Terminal: Create New Terminal’.

   Using the Integrated Terminal
   Once the terminal is opened, it can be used just like any other command-line interface. Below are some basic operations and ways of using the integrated terminal:

   a.	Running Commands:
   Type your command into the terminal and press Enter to execute it. For example, you can navigate directories, run scripts, install packages, etc.
   cd my-project
   npm install
   git status

   b.	Creating Multiple Terminals:
   You can create multiple terminal instances to run different commands simultaneously.
   Click the + icon in the terminal panel to open a new terminal instance.
   Use the dropdown menu next to the + icon to switch between terminals or to kill a terminal instance.

   c.	Splitting Terminals:
   You can split the terminal to view and work in multiple terminals side by side.
   Click the split terminal icon (usually next to the + icon) to split the terminal horizontally. Each split terminal can run independent commands.

   d.	The integrated terminal can be configured to use different shell types like Bash, PowerShell, Command Prompt, or any other shell installed on the system. To change the default shell, go to File > Preferences > Settings, search for "terminal integrated shell", and set the desired shell for your operating system.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Install Git:

      Download and install Git from git-scm.com.

   Open a Project in VS Code:

      Launch VS Code from your project folder.

   Initialize a Git Repository:

      Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``).
      Navigate to your project directory if necessary.
      Run 'git init' to initialize a new Git repository.

   Stage and Commit Changes:

      Stage all files in your project folder: git add .
      Commit the staged changes: git commit -m "Initial commit"

   Connect to a Remote Repository:

      Create a remote repository on GitHub.
      Add the remote repository: 'git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>'
      Push the initial commit: 'git push -u origin master'

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
